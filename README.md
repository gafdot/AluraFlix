# AluraFlix
The AluraFlix API is the back-end for a video sharing platform. This project was developed so I can introduce my programming skills. 
Therefore, since now I want to thank you for your attention and for the time you are spending checking out my work.

To build this API, I applied the RESTful principles and developed it using the Java language. 
I implemented Spring Boot Framework to set up the web application. Regarding the database, I persisted on MySQL and for the tests I employed the in-memory H2. 
The integration was done using JPA and Hibernate technologies, beyond Spring Data which provided the connection with the database. 
I also implemented a security layer for authentication and authorization and for that adopted Spring Security Framework. 
In the test scenario, Spring Boot already adds by default the ‘starter test’ dependency, besides, 
I still had to apply the Spring Security Test due to the security layer already mentioned.

Once more I thank you for your attention and, if there is still any doubt or suggestion, please contact me at my LinkedIn profile:
